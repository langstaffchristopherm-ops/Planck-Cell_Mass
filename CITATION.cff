title: "Planck-Cell Mass"
abstract: >
  Derivation of inertial and rest mass from the Planck-Cell S/t framework:
  tick-based kinematics on a bounded-degree graph, local energy accounting,
  massâ€“energy relations from path statistics, and calibration against
  rest-energy and momentum-transfer tests. Repository contains the
  release PDF and LaTeX source.
