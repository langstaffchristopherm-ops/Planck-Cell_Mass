Mass is defined operationally as the \emph{temporal stiffness} of the Planck-Cell medium, with the dictionary \(m=\hbar\omega_0/c^2\). Building on kinematics where the front (signal) speed is fixed at \(c\) while internal phase accrues locally, we present a minimal non-gravitational dynamics in which an onsite stiffness yields the dispersion \(\omega^2=c^2\kappa^2+\omega_0^2\).

We show how three regimes instantiate the same knob \(\omega_0\): (i) a \textbf{Higgs background} sets a species-independent stiffness scale \(\omega_0^{\mathrm{Higgs}}=v/\hbar\) so that \(m_X\propto c_X v\); (ii) \textbf{QCD binding} acts as an emergent stiffness \(\omega_0^{\mathrm{QCD}}\sim \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}/\hbar\), explaining hadron masses without attributing them to bare quark rest terms; and (iii) \textbf{neutrinos} illustrate minimal stiffness, where tiny \(\omega_0^\nu\) leaves \(v_g\approx c\) yet provides the phase for oscillations, \(\Delta\phi\simeq \Delta m^2 c^3 L/(2\hbar E)\).

We connect \(\omega_0\) to laboratory observables—Compton clocks, Debye and plasma frequencies, precision spectroscopy, and interferometry—and give a falsifier template for any substrate signatures that must fade with wavelength as \(r(\lambda)\lesssim A\big(\xi_g/\lambda\big)^{p}\) (\(p>0\)).

We also outline differential-clock strategies to bound possible drift \(\dot{\omega}_0/\omega_0\) without presuming a signal. The result is a single, testable narrative for mass that unifies particle, nuclear, and condensed-matter scales while cleanly separating propagation speed from phase rate; gravity is deferred to a companion article.
