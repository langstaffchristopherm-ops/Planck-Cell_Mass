\section*{Abstract}
We remove geometry as an input and show that standard metric behavior and weak-field redshift emerge from uniform, causal ticks of entropy--time. 
Mass is defined operationally as the temporal stiffness of the Planck-Cell medium, with the dictionary 
\[
  m = \frac{\hbar \omega_0}{c^2}.
\]
Building on kinematics where the signal front moves at \(c\) while internal phase accrues locally, we present a minimal non-gravitational dynamics in which onsite stiffness yields the dispersion
\[
  \omega^2 = c^2 \kappa^2 + \omega_0^2.
\]

Three regimes instantiate the same knob \(\omega_0\):
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item A Higgs background sets a universal stiffness scale 
  \(\omega_0^{\mathrm{Higgs}} = v / \hbar.\)
  \item QCD binding acts as an emergent stiffness 
  \(\omega_0^{\mathrm{QCD}} \approx \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}} / \hbar,\)
  explaining hadron masses without bare-quark rest terms.
  \item Neutrinos illustrate minimal stiffness, where tiny 
  \(\omega_0^\nu\) leaves \(v_g \approx c\) yet provides the phase for oscillations.
\end{enumerate}

We connect \(\omega_0\) to Compton clocks, Debye and plasma frequencies, spectroscopy, and interferometry, and propose differential-clock tests to bound any drift \((\dot{\omega}_0 / \omega_0)\). 
The result is a single, testable narrative for mass that unifies particle, nuclear, and condensed-matter scales while cleanly separating propagation speed from phase rate.
