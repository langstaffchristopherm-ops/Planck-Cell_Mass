\section*{Introduction}

In \emph{Planck--Cell Mass} the notion of mass arises not from rest energy as an
assumption but from temporal stiffness within the tick medium.  Defining
$m = \hbar\omega_0/c^2$ connects inertia directly to an intrinsic oscillation
rate~$\omega_0$ of the Planck--Cell substrate.  This single knob unifies particle,
nuclear, and condensed--matter masses: Higgs stiffness, QCD binding, and
neutrino oscillations become distinct realizations of the same rate parameter.
The framework cleanly separates propagation speed from internal phase rate and
offers falsifiable laboratory links through Compton clocks, spectroscopy, and
frequency--drift bounds.
