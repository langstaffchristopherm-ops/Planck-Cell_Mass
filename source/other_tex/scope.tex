\section*{Scope and falsifiability}
This paper develops the \emph{Planck-Cell S/t framework} interpretation of
mass as an intrinsic temporal stiffness of the adjacency substrate,
quantified by the local rate $\omega_{0}$ with $m=\hbar\omega_{0}/c^{2}$.
The results concern interior regions of a bounded-degree, approximately
isotropic network in which no entity advances more than one hop per global
tick.  The framework is falsified by any persistent deviation from the
predicted long-wavelength suppression of residuals,
\[
r(\lambda)\lesssim A(\xi_{g}/\lambda)^{p},\qquad p>0,
\]
where $\xi_{g}$ is the effective grain scale.  Immediate falsifiers include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item a wavelength-independent fractional residual in dispersion,
        anisotropy, or phaseâ€“time matching that fails to diminish as
        $\lambda/\xi_{g}\!\to\!\infty$;
  \item a measurable drift or secular offset in the stiffness rate
        $\dot{\omega}_{0}/\omega_{0}$ exceeding current clock-comparison bounds;
  \item inconsistent scaling of inferred masses across Compton, plasma,
        and lattice frequency regimes once calibrated by a single species.
\end{enumerate}
Any non-vanishing residual, unaccounted drift, or cross-regime inconsistency
violates the tick-stiffness postulate and falsifies the mass layer of the
framework.
