\section*{Scope and falsifiability.}
This paper states the assumptions, derivations, and empirical checks within the \emph{Planck-Cell S/t framework} for the specific topic---kinematics, mass, gravity, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, or expansion. It is not a full textbook; external references provide background where needed. Acceptance tests and links to related records appear at the end. All claims apply to \emph{interior regions} of a bounded-degree, approximately isotropic adjacency substrate in which no entity advances more than one hop per global tick. Immediate falsifiers include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item measurable vacuum group-velocity dispersion in transit speed;
  \item weak-field slopes outside the range $\hat{\beta} \in [0.97,1.03]$ (Eq.~6);
  \item interior distortions exceeding $f(N)$ as defined in Theorem~2; or
  \item reproducible superluminal signalling through nonlocal shortcuts.
\end{enumerate}
